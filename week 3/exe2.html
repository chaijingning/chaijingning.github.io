    <h1>Chai Jing Ning</h1>
    <h2>We live in a raimbow of chaos</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Jing Ning and I'm currently a student from Dasein Academy of Art of Digital Media Course.
        During my free
        time, I would be drawing or reading during my free time. I am mostly intrested in digital drawings of characters
        or watercolor paintings, illustrations, 3D modeling and anyting related to crafts.
    </p>
    <p>I have also a great intrest in fashion and colors since I find that every shade and tones could
        express many
        feelings and different colors combination on clothes could make either a nice view or a fashion disaster.
    </p>
