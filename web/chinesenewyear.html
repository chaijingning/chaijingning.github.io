            <h2>Chinese New Year</h2>
            <p>Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival (春节 / Chūn Jié), is the most important
                traditional
                festival in China. It marks the beginning of the lunar new year, usually falling between
                late
                January and mid-February. It’s a time for family reunions, festive meals, and cultural
                celebrations
                that last up to 15 days, ending with the Lantern Festival.</p>

        <p>Chinese New Year has been celebrated for over 4,000 years. It began as a seasonal celebration marking the
            end of winter and the beginning of spring. Over time, it became more connected to family, rituals, and
            traditional beliefs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            During the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), it became tied to the lunar calendar. Later dynasties
            developed customs like fireworks, red decorations, and lion dances. Today, it is a national holiday
            celebrated in many countries with Chinese communities.

                <div class="story">
                    <p>The most famous legend behind Chinese New Year is about a monster called Nian (年). Nian would
                        come out every New Year’s Eve to attack villages and frighten people. However, villagers
                        discovered that Nian was afraid of loud noises, bright lights, and the color red. From then on,
                        people began to hang red decorations, set off firecrackers, and stay up late to protect their
                        homes—traditions that continue today.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese New Year also marks the beginning of a new year in the Chinese zodiac cycle, which
                        has 12 animals. According to legend, the Jade Emperor held a race to decide the order of the
                        zodiac. The Rat won by cleverly riding on the back of the Ox and jumping ahead at the last
                        moment. Each year is associated with a different zodiac animal and its characteristics,
                        influencing people's personalities and fortunes.</p>
